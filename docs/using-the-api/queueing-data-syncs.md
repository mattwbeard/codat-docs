## Check data 'freshness'

Use the `GET /companies/{companyId}/dataStatus` endpoint to check the [last time each data type was synchronized](/core-concepts/status).

In this request, `companyId` is [the unique ID that you have received in a response to creating this company](/using-the-api/managing-companies#create-a-codat-company).

When you’re pulling data for the first time, use this endpoint to check if the sync was successful.

`GET /companies/{companyId}/dataStatus`

```json title="Response for a successful first sync"
{
  "suppliers": {
    "dataType": "suppliers",
    "lastSuccessfulSync": "2019-06-11T13:26:54.6884704Z",
    "currentStatus": "Complete",
    "latestSyncId": "31632c48-23dc-4cb1-b3ff-0829343c8e85",
    "latestSuccessfulSyncId": "31632c48-23dc-4cb1-b3ff-0829343c8e85"
  },
  ...
}
```

```json title="Response for an unsuccessful first sync"
{
  "suppliers": {
    "dataType": "suppliers”
    "currentStatus": "FetchError",
    "latestSyncId": "31632c48-23dc-4cb1-b3ff-0829343c8e85",
  },
  ...
}
```

## Refresh data

There are [two POST endpoints in the API](/codat-api#/operations/create--many-pull-operations) for queuing a refresh of data:

1. `/companies/{companyId}/data/all`
   - Will queue a dataset for each of the data types marked as _Fetch on first link_ in your [data type settings](/core-concepts/data-type-settings), where that data type is supported by the company's linked data connections
2. `/companies/{companyId}/data/queue/{dataType}`
   - Will queue a dataset for the specified data type
   - _dataType_ is the key of the data type e.g. `invoices`

:::info Multiple dataset queued exception

If you try to queue a synchronization for a data type that is already in process, you'll receive an exception.

```
"error": "DatasetAlreadyInProgressException: Cannot queue {dataType} sync for {companyId} as previous sync {dataSetId} is still in progress"
```
:::

Refreshing data can take different amounts of time depending on the integration and the amount of data being retrieved. You can use [webhooks](/introduction/webhooks/core-rules-types) to be updated when the operation completes.
