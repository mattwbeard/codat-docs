- Schedule data syncs to refresh data daily, weekly, or monthly (but not hourly).

## Moving to a paid plan

You have two options when you're ready to move to a paid plan. You can:

- Pay through Stripe on our start-up plan based on your monthly usage.
- [Contact our sales team](https://www.codat.io/plans/#get-in-touch) to discuss enterprise pricing options.

If you're an Admin, you can view the available pricing plans and upgrade via Stripe by visiting <a href="https://app.codat.io/settings/billing" target="_blank">Billing</a> in the Codat Portal.

### Start-up plan billing

When using our start-up plan, you do not pay any monthly commitment fees. Instead, you will be charged for **each active company**. Active companies represent your customer connections where you have successfully pulled or pushed data within your billing period. 

You can use our Billing [dashboard](https://app.codat.io/settings/billing/usage) to track your usage and stay in control of your bills. 

:::tip Sandbox connections

Active companies that are connected **only** to Codat Sanbox or QuickBooks Online Sandbox are excluded from the billing of the Start-up plan.
